# READ-PLEASE
Dear Follower, Lately I had a lot of trouble in my life. I mean this was the worst 4 years I ever knowed.  
i get use to allways bottle up everything in me. I started a Youtube Channel 7 years ago.  
doing my lil video and having fun. i meet a lot of People some was nice, other not, at the begining every message count, goodor bad,  
and the bad one hurts you a lot. and with the time you get over it... just thinking they are haters, dont care anymore...  
Then i start growing fast... really fast  
take 10K sub in less than a month.    
ppl start watching you take every word you say and praise them, or judge them.  
I start growing up because i start scam bait in youtube france. this series was boring me, so i stop producing it.  
at this time i was my Character, i was Sirius, Not Quentin Silva, both was the same person.  
Every message was for me. every insult was for me personally.  
At this time everyone just want my scam bait series, no one was watching other video i produce...  
I start slowly falling in depression, and of course one probleme never come alone, a lotof shit was falling on me.  
I get in deep depression, money issue, familly issue, and all that "good" stuff.  
I almost get homeless, ppl was leaving me, i start thinking about the worst, and still keeping everything inside.  
Until I meet "[The Wall](http://TheWall.ovh)" a little group of friends i meet on WoW. We created a Discord server and start talking everyday.  
On of my friend start pushing me to open myself to other and stop keeping everything inside, so i tell them my story, they helped me a lot, for the first time i wasent Sirius, I was juste me.  
it was like this song of miku "Rolling Girl"  
  ```
Repeating every word and hiding every meaning
"Are you better now?"
"No. I don't know how"
Maybe someday you'll see the progress I'm doing
Please, just let me stop my breath
Not now...
Just once more, just once more
"I will roll again today I now for sure"
Oh, that girl said, what she said.
Playing every word and playing to pretend
"Just once more? No, No more"
Take my hand and come with me
It will be okay
Please, just let me hold your breath for now.
```  

This song was exactly my feeling.  
  
  
but i still was Sirius when i wasent with them.   
until today, One more Drama... i took it personally because it was someone impresonating me, using my website, description, name, everything... and he was harassing me.  
We all have a limite, and this limite was passed.  
I take the decision to take down Sirius, becoming me...  
but for this i have to leave everyhing is linked with Sirius. this github include.  
i'm not gonna give my new GitHub because no i dont stop coding stuff... just need a fresh start.  
  
For the end, I want to say Thanks you to all of my friend, for supporting me.  
i'm going to feel way better from now. Thanks you guys! <3  
Also i want to say thanks you to everyone helped me here, on code, and website optimisation or for fixing stuff.  
  
Thanks you.
